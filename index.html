            <h3>Basic Order Book</h3>
            <p>An order book is a real-time list of buy and sell orders for a specific asset, like a stock, currency, or cryptocurrency. It’s a core component in markets, providing transparency about current supply and demand and helping traders make decisions. Order books display bid orders (buy) and ask orders (sell), often sorted by price and showing the quantity available at each price level.</p>

            <h3>Black-Scholes Pricing Model</h3>
            <p>The Black-Scholes Pricing Model is a mathematical model used to calculate the theoretical price of European-style options. This model provides a formula that factors in the stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the stock. It’s widely used in finance for valuing options and is particularly useful for options that don’t pay dividends.

            <h3>Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>
            <p>A Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to estimate numerical results, especially useful in cases where an analytical solution is complex or impossible to obtain. In finance, it's often used for option pricing, risk analysis, and portfolio management, relying on randomness to simulate a range of outcomes and determine their probabilities.</p>
